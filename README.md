# Git-Cheatsheet
This is my collection of git commands that I will use

### git init
Initialise a git repository in the folder that you are currently present in the terminal

### git add \<filenames\>
Add the files that will shift from the present working directory to the staging area

### git status
List all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed in the current git repository

### git restore --cached \<filenames\>
Remove the filenames from the staging area

### git commit -m "Your message"
Commit the changes that are present in the staging area. The commit has an associated hash value with it that uniquely identifies the commit

### git log -(number)
- number is optional
- Logs all the commits that have been made if number is not specified, else logs the latest (number) of commits that have been made on the present branch
- Sometimes when logging, the terminal may hang. Press q and press enter to exit

### git checkout \<filename\>
- Undo all the changes that have been made to *filename* since the most recent commit

### git restore \<filename\>
- Undo all the changes that have been made to *filename* since the most recent commit

### git revert \<hashcode\>
- Haven't used this yet, so not so sure
- Reverts back all the changes that have been performed since the *hashcode commit*
- It changes the repository to the stage before the *hashcode commit* was made

### git branch
List all the branches that are currently present

### git branch \<branchname\>
Create a new branch with *branchname*

### git checkout \<branchname\>
Shift to the specified branchname

### git checkout -b \<branchname\>
A shortcut to create a new branch and shift onto it

### git branch -d \<branchname\>
- Delete the specified *branchname*
- Git does not allow to delete the branch you are currently on

### git branch -m \<old-branch\> \<new-branch\>
- Rename the *old-branch* to *new-branch*

### git branch -m \<new-branch\>
- Rename the current branch to *new-branch*

### git merge \<branchname\>
- Merge the specified \<branchname\> with the current branch
- If there are any conflicts, they will need to be solved first 
- If there are no conflicts, Vim editor will open in terminal on which we can write our commit message
- Type **:q!** to exit the Vim editor and commit the changes

### git remote add \<name\> \<url\>
- Create a new connection to a remote repository. After adding a remote, you’ll be able to use *name* as a convenient shortcut for *url* in other Git commands.
- *name* can be anything, but by convention it is set as **origin**
- *url* is the url of the github repository

### git push \<remote-name\> \<branch-name\> -u
- Push the specified branch to the the remote repository

### git push \<remote-name\> \<local-branch-name\>:\<remote-branch-name\> 
This pushes the *local-branch-name* to your *remote-name*, but it is renamed to *remote-branch-name*

### git clone \<url\>
Clones the remote repository onto our local folder
